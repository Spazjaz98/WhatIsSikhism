## Welcome to Jaskirat's World


# Sikhism
Alot of people first see me and see my religion. 
And for good reason considering this is what I look like.
You can use the link below to learn more about my religion.

Its a pretty funny video to keep you entertained for 5 mins
starring a semi-funny comedian!

## Education
The other big component of my day is being a student at UIUC! 
Here is a link to UIUC's fun facts and bragging rights.
Maybe its not worth $100 a day for four years (even the days I don't have classes!)
But at least I'm not from out of state :P
