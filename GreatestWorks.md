I find that my greatest works were always in literature and so I wrote this poem

black. Sky is 
blue. Grass is
green. Clouds are 
white. Roses are 
red. Bananas are 
yellow. Eggplant is
purple. Carrots are
orange. Flamingos are
pink. Dirt is 
brown. Roads are 

This poem represents code that is not properly indented,
and why checkstyle is a blessing although we call it a curse.
